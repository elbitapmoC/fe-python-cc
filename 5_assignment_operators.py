# Create a variable called secret_num and set it to any number you'd like:
secret_num = 777

# Increase secret_num by 1
secret_num += 1

# Next, take the new number and double it
secret_num *= 2

# Next, take the new number and add four to it
secret_num += 4

# Next, take the new number and divide by two
secret_num /= 2

# Next, take the new number and subtract your original secret number from it
secret_num -= 777

# Print the final result
print(secret_num)
